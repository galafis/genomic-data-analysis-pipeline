# Aligner Comparison and Benchmarking

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive framework for benchmarking and comparing genomic sequence alignment tools within our genomic data analysis pipeline. The comparison methodology outlined here ensures reproducible and standardized evaluation of different alignment algorithms to guide tool selection for specific use cases.

## Comparison Criteria

### 1. Speed and Performance
- **Alignment Speed**: Time to complete alignment (reads/second)
- **Memory Usage**: Peak RAM consumption during alignment
- **CPU Utilization**: Multi-threading efficiency and core usage
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing dataset sizes

### 2. Accuracy Metrics
- **Mapping Quality**: MAPQ scores distribution
- **Alignment Score**: Raw alignment scores and normalized metrics
- **Error Rate**: Mismatch, insertion, and deletion frequencies
- **Coverage Uniformity**: Even distribution across reference genome
- **Sensitivity**: Proportion of true alignments detected
- **Specificity**: Proportion of reported alignments that are correct

### 3. Resource Requirements
- **Memory Footprint**: RAM requirements for index and alignment
- **Storage Requirements**: Index size and temporary file usage
- **Computational Complexity**: Big-O notation for time and space
- **Hardware Dependencies**: GPU support, vector instructions

### 4. Functionality and Features
- **Read Types Supported**: Single-end, paired-end, long reads
- **Reference Formats**: FASTA, compressed formats support
- **Output Formats**: SAM, BAM, CRAM compatibility
- **Parameter Flexibility**: Customization options available

## Standard Methodology

### Dataset Preparation
As described in the main README, our benchmarking follows these steps:

1. **Reference Datasets**:
   - Human genome (GRCh38/hg38)
   - Simulated reads with known ground truth
   - Real sequencing data from standard samples

2. **Read Simulation**:
   ```bash
   # Generate synthetic reads for controlled testing
   art_illumina -ss HS25 -i reference.fa -l 150 -f 30 -o simulated_
   ```

3. **Benchmarking Environment**:
   - Standardized hardware configuration
   - Isolated system resources
   - Multiple independent runs for statistical significance

### Evaluation Protocol

#### Performance Measurement
```bash
# Time and memory profiling template
/usr/bin/time -v aligner [options] reference.fa reads.fastq > alignment.sam 2> metrics.log
```

#### Accuracy Assessment
```bash
# Calculate alignment statistics
samtools flagstat alignment.bam
samtools stats alignment.bam

# Compare against ground truth (for simulated data)
python evaluate_alignment.py --truth truth.sam --test alignment.sam
```

## Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Speed Comparison
```python
# Performance analysis script excerpt
import time
import psutil

def benchmark_aligner(aligner_cmd, reads_file, reference):
    start_time = time.time()
    process = subprocess.Popen(aligner_cmd, shell=True)
    
    # Monitor resource usage
    max_memory = 0
    while process.poll() is None:
        try:
            proc = psutil.Process(process.pid)
            memory_mb = proc.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
            max_memory = max(max_memory, memory_mb)
        except:
            pass
        time.sleep(1)
    
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    return elapsed_time, max_memory
```

### Example 2: Accuracy Evaluation
```python
# Accuracy metrics calculation
def calculate_accuracy_metrics(sam_file, ground_truth):
    metrics = {
        'total_reads': 0,
        'mapped_reads': 0,
        'correctly_mapped': 0,
        'mapping_quality_avg': 0
    }
    
    with pysam.AlignmentFile(sam_file, 'r') as sam:
        for read in sam:
            metrics['total_reads'] += 1
            if not read.is_unmapped:
                metrics['mapped_reads'] += 1
                metrics['mapping_quality_avg'] += read.mapping_quality
    
    return metrics
```
